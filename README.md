# Underwater_Spy_Camera
Oceallus is an open-source, cost-effective, adjustable underwater camera system developed to observe marine life, specifically clams and lobsters, at depths of up to 30 meters. Existing systems are prohibitively expensive for many research groups, so this project focuses on creating a reproducible solution using off-the-shelf and 3D-printed parts, reducing costs while maintaining high performance. The camera system addresses several challenges, including stability on uneven seafloor terrain, reliable waterproofing, extended battery life for four-week deployments, corrosion resistance, and minimizing disturbance to marine life. Key features include a custom-designed tripod with adjustable legs and arms for stability, pressure-proofed enclosures, a Raspberry Pi Zero for power-efficient operation, and an infrared lighting system to avoid disturbing animals. The system captures images at 1080p resolution with an adjustable frame rate and time-lapse parameters, providing flexibility for various research needs.  By default, the system takes one photo every five minutes and assembles the photos into a time-lapse video, but these settings can be modified through user-defined parameters, ensuring thorough documentation of the underwater environment.
